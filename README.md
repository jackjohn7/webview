# WebView

This is just a basic video streaming platform designed with
the sole purpose of familiarizing myself with microservices
and more complex architecture design. I also wanted to get
familiar with how streaming of video works.

This also will function as POC for video stuff I may do in 
the future. If I ever decide to make an education platform,
I'll already know how to go about doing that.

For the time being, the only actual function that this will serve is that a person can upload a video and then watch their videos locally self-hosted.
